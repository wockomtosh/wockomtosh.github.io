                    Back Off Me Booty is an alt controller cooperative on-rails shooter developed using Unreal Engine. 
                    Players use a seesaw controller to change the tilt of a pirate ship and fire the cannons to protect their loot from enemies.
                    I was responsible for programming the controller, processing controller inputs, creating the level flow, and engineering the environment.

                    Deep Sea Defender is a prototype developed in Unreal Engine. It is a top-down shooter with built-in Twitch integration.
                    When Twitch mode is enabled the Twitch Chat can control the boss AI. I was one of three programmers on the project.
                    I focused on enemy AI, general game flow, UI, menus, and helping with Twitch functionality.

                    This project was developed using Unreal Engine 4.

                    This is a VR prototype developed using the Unity engine. I was one of two programmers on the project. 
                    This was meant to be a serious game based on Carl Jung's statement, "You are what you do, not what you say you'll do." 
                    The player is presented with a quiz, after which they can make choices in different scenarios.
