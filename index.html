                Hello, I'm Jacob Liddle! I'm a master's student at the University of Utah studying Entertainment Arts Engineering. 
                I'm passionate about creating games and helping other people have the good experiences that I've had with games. 
                I love programming and watching my code come to life.

                <p>This was a capstone project at BYU that was developed over the course of a year in Unreal Engine 4. 
                    I worked on prototyping, enemy behavior, player abilities, and UI implementation.</p>

                <p>This is a VR prototype developed in 4 weeks at the University of Utah using the Unity engine. 
                    I was one of two programmers on the project. This was meant to be a serious game based on Carl Jung's statement, 
                    "You are what you do, not what you say you'll do."
