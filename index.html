                Hello, I'm Jacob Liddle! I'm a master's student at the University of Utah studying Entertainment Arts Engineering. 
                I'm passionate about creating games and helping other people have the incredible experiences that I've had with games. 
                I love watching my code come to life.

            <h2>C++ Scene Loading System</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                I created a scene loading system to fit into a pre-existing C++ game engine. This system has a custom human-readable scene file format using Lua, a builder to 
                convert the human-readable file into binary, and the system itself. The scene system has some dependencies on libraries from that engine, so those would need 
                to be replaced for this to be used in another game engine.

            <h2>C++ AI Engine</h2>
            <p class="short-description">
                I created a C++ game engine focused on learning about AI implementation. It uses OpenFrameworks for rendering. This engine was worked on in three parts over the course of several months. In the 
                first part I implemented various dynamic steering behaviors including arrive, evade, wander, and flocking. In the second part I implemented pathfinding using a tile graph
                and the A* algorithm with a couple different heuristics. In the third part I implemented decision-making behaviors including an action manager, behavior trees, 
                decision trees, and goal-oriented action planning.

                    Back Off Me Booty is an alt controller cooperative on-rails shooter developed using Unreal Engine. 
                    Players use a seesaw controller to change the tilt of a pirate ship and fire the cannons to protect their loot from enemies.
                    I was responsible for programming the controller, processing controller inputs, creating the level flow, and engineering the environment.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Back Off Me Booty was showcased at Indiecade Night Games 2024 and won the Night Games Audience Choice Award.

                    Deep Sea Defender is a prototype developed in Unreal Engine. It is a top-down shooter with built-in Twitch integration.
                    When Twitch mode is enabled the Twitch Chat can control the boss AI. I was one of three programmers on the project.
                    I focused on enemy AI, general game flow, UI, menus, and helping with Twitch functionality.

                    This is a VR prototype developed using the Unity engine. I was one of two programmers on the project. 
                    This was meant to be a serious game based on Carl Jung's statement, "You are what you do, not what you say you'll do." 
                    The player is presented with a quiz, after which they can make choices in different scenarios.
