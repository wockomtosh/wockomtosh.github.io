            This is assignment 6 for GAMES6320. In this assignment I made a MeshBuilder that allows me to create mesh files in a custom file format 
            and use them in my game without having to have any geometry data in the code. This will make it possible to get meshes from an modeling tool 
            like Maya (after some additional work). I used Lua with C++ to load the files, which was very new to me. I have used Lua as a scripting 
            language before, but I've never used Lua in C++. It took a long time to understand how to use Lua in C++, but after that was done the actual 
            implementation wasn't super difficult. Most of the time was spent in just understanding how to think in a different way to use Lua. Another big 
            part of this assignment was designing my file format to be human readable, which I will discuss further down on this page. 
            <br/><br/>
            I ran into a bug with my meshes where I knew all the data was being read correctly, but there were still 
            issues in the meshes. It ended up not being a Lua problem luckily, but a problem with my indexing. This happened because of how I decided 
            to store index data. Because every three indices represent a triangle, my file format holds indices in threes. However, my indexData in the code 
            is stored as a plain array, and I wasn't moving the indices to that array properly. Once I figured out the problem it was an easy fix, but it 
            was hard to track down because it was such a simple thing that I wouldn't normally consider. I had to look at indexData in memory before I realized what was happening.
            Other than that bug, the assignment was moderately challenging to understand how to use Lua, but more time-consuming than challenging. 
            I think using Lua itself isn't too hard, but when you add in all of the required error checking the code becomes very unreadable and hard to 
            work with, which slowed me down a lot.

            My file format is pretty straightforward and I think it's very readable. It's a Lua table with two keys, one for vertex data and one for 
            index data. The vertex data contains an array of vertices. Each vertex is a table containing position data. I made each vertex a 
            table so that later on I can easily add color data or things like that if I want to or need to. The index data is labeled as indexDataForTriangles 
            to make it clear that indices represent triangles. It is an array of arrays. Each of the arrays inside of the index data has 3 elements, 
            which makes it really easy to think about things and work with the data in terms of triangles. If there is an issue with a triangle 
            this makes it much easier to track it down.
            <br/><br/>
            Having human readable files is really helpful for debugging purposes. Having extra information in a file is less efficient, but because we can switch to 
            something like a binary file after building (to be done in a later assignment) it doesn't make a difference to the end user. It is a benefit to the developers. 
            If something goes wrong for a mesh, or if I want to make a quick change to a mesh then having a human readable file is 
            really nice. It's also really easy to annotate with things like vertex IDs and triangle numbers, which can further help with debugging and manual editing.

            This is a screenshot of me debugging my MeshBuilder. I initially had problems with debugging because when I set my command arguments in Visual Studio 
            I forgot to set it to be all platforms and configurations, and I was on the wrong configuration.
