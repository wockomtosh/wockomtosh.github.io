            This contains the scene project, SceneBuilder.exe, and an example scene file. I also included the SceneBuilder project in case the executable is hard to use.

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <img src="images\SceneHeaderFile.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            The scene system allows you to organize objects into scenes and load/unload those scenes as one unit. This makes it easier to organize your world
            and manage level flow. It can also be used for level streaming or loading in a group of objects all at once. The scene system keeps a list of loaded 
            scenes along with a list of persistent scene objects (which will be explained more later). 
            <br/>
            The core of the scene system is loading and unloading scenes. The LoadNewScene function will unload all existing scenes and load in a new one. 
            The LoadAdditionalScene function loads a new scene without unloading any other scenes. UnloadSceneByID unloads a particular scene. 
            The system provides several functions for searching scene objects. These include searching by object ID, scene ID, type, and searching for persistent objects.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I set it up in my project?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            Add the scene project to your solution. Set up the property sheets in the same way as the rest of the Engine projects, and make sure it is set to be a static lib.
            The Scene project has references to Physics and Results. In AssetBuildFunctions.lua add a call to NewAssetTypeInfo in the same way that we set up the mesh builder, 
            but use SceneBuilder.exe instead of MeshBuilder.exe. If SceneBuilder.exe is hard to work with then set up the SceneBuilder project in the same way that we set up 
            the MeshBuilder project and you can use that instead. Add your scene files to AssetsToBuild.lua. 
        </p>

        <h2>What is a scene?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            A scene is composed of Scene Objects. cSceneObject is an abstract class that can be used to allow objects to be loaded as part of a scene. All scene objects have 
            an ID, a type, and whether they are persistent between scenes. Persistent scene objects will not be unloaded by the scene system. When a persistent object is loaded 
            as part of a scene, it is added to a separate list of persistent scene objects. In addition to these properties, scene objects have a virtual function that can be implemented 
            called OnSceneLoaded, which is called by the system after all scene objects have loaded.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I make a scene object?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            To implement a scene object, you need to create a class that inherits from cSceneObject. Then, you need to implement a static Load function (an example is shown below).
            This function tells the scene system how to treat your derived scene object class. This function should allocate memory for your scene object and load and set up any 
            additional data needed for your object. It is passed a map of additional data. This data is set up in the scene file, and can contain anything the user wants. The intention 
            is for the additional data to contain file paths or other small pieces of information necessary to instantiate your class. This load function could also be used to 
            store a reference to these objects in a manager or some other place in your code. For example, I could store all renderable objects in a list somewhere and add them to 
            that list whenever one is loaded here.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I make a scene file?</h2>
        <img src="images\FinalSceneObject.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            A scene file consists of a list of scene objects. Each scene object is required to have a type and any additional data necessary for that object. Each scene object 
            can optionally have a position, orientation, and whether it is persistent between scenes. By default they will have a 0 position and orientation and will not be persistent.
            The type is a uint16_t that is used by the system to know which load function to use for that object. I recommend storing this as a static member of the class you create.
            The types are set by the user. Any additional data is stored as a list of pairs of strings. Anything can theoretically be stored here, but it is recommended to keep it short.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How do I use it in my game?</h2>
        <img src="images\InGameUse.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            To use this system in your game, first you need to implement your scene objects. Then you should initialize and cleanup the system when your game initializes and cleans up.
            When you initialize your game you should also register your load functions. To do this you pass in your object type along with the static load function to the scene system.
            After that is done you can load a scene and search for scene objects in whatever way fits your use case.
        </p>

        <h2>How did I use what I've learned this semester?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            I used a lot of what I learned in this class in this project. The biggest things were user-focused design, designing a human-readable file format, and thinking about the future 
            but not too far into the future. When creating this system I tried to focus in on what I or another user would actually use in a game. There were some features that could have 
            been interesting but probably wouldn't have actually been useful in this context. For example, I knew that probably no one would actually need level streaming for their games 
            in this class, so I didn't put extra effort into creating a system that could take in conditions for when to load new scenes. I instead just provided a function that could 
            allow users to load in additional scenes since they likely wouldn't want or use a more complicated system. I also ran into some issues where I tried to minimize the impact 
            on the user. For example, figuring out how to provide a good way to search for a specific object in a scene proved to be more difficult than I thought, but to compensate for 
            that I tried to provide several ways to search for objects to hopefully provide the user with a good option. I never came up with something that I think is amazing, but I 
            at least was able to provide some level of search functionality.
            <br/>
            When thinking about the future I tried to think one step ahead but not too far beyond that. For example, I could have made a much more elaborate system for object and scene 
            IDs that would be more future-proof, but doing so would have consumed a lot more development time for something that isn't necessary for smaller games like the ones 
            we are going to make. Another part was that I think a better system for providing additional data would be necessary for larger games, but doing so would have potentially required 
            a more complicated file lookup system that would not have been worth the time to create for this.
        </p>

        <h2>What did I learn and what did I struggle with?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            There were a lot of major difficulties in this project. The first was how to design the file format. It took me a long time to figure out how I wanted to let users 
            store arbitrary data for their scene objects, and I'm not totally satisfied with what I came up with. But using a map of strings seems like a useful starting place.
            Ideally I'd want a file lookup system where each file in our project could have a GUID and the additional data could just be a list of files using that. But that would not 
            only require the file lookup system, but also probably an editor of some sort that would manage and generate the GUIDs. In the end I had to compromise by using a map and 
            strings.
            <br/> 
            Another major difficulty was how do I load a derived class from the perspective of a base class? I was stumped by this for a while before remembering something I learned 
            in a previous semester, which is where I got the idea for the static load functions. After I had that idea, there were still a few difficult parts to work with. That's 
            when I added the type specifiers to scene objects, because I realized that I still needed a way to know which load function to use. But overall after I remembered that 
            pattern I was able to implement it without too much difficulty.
            <br/>
            Another struggle was building the file into binary and reading it from there. More than anything it was just annoying with so much information to write and dealing with 
            strings. I wanted it to be a really fast read and write like our mesh files were, but I had to settle with a slower way because I was using strings. 
            <br/>
            Overall, this project was really helpful to put the things I've learned from this class into practice by making a new system from scratch.
            It helped cement what I've learned so far and I also learned plenty of new things as I went.
