            This is assignment 7 for GAMES6320. In this assignment I wrote some code that would allow a Maya plugin to export meshes in my file format.
            I created a few meshes to test this with. I also enabled depth buffering and added color to these meshes and updated my file format to be able to process vertex color data.
            Overall this was probably the easiest assignment so far, which is why I did the extra challenge to add vertex color data. Doing that wasn't terribly difficult, but I ran into
            some bugs when trying to update the D3D shaders to use color information. I didn't know how D3D uses inputs and outputs, so I did that wrong initially. HOW DID I FIX THIS?
            The rest of the assignment was extremely straightforward, though it still took some time. Exporting meshes with my file format was very easy. I decided 
            to add a lot of the unused data like normal, tangent, and texture coordinates because it was something that was really easy to do now but could make my life 
            easier in the future. It seemed like a very low-cost thing that could save time later so that I don't have to come back to this plugin as much.
            <br/><br/>
            My MayaMeshExporter project needed a reference added for the Engine/Windows project, but that was the only one. There are also no other projects that depend on 
            the MayaMeshExporter because it builds an external plugin, so if we don't need meshes created then the rest of the game and engine can ignore it.
            <br/><br/>
            To test the limits of how many vertices could be loaded in a single model I created a mesh with many spheres. When I loaded this model and tried 
            to render it, it seemed to drop vertices after a certain point. Several spheres weren't rendered at all and some were rendered partially.
            WHAT IS THE LIMIT
