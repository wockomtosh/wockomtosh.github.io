        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <img src="images/GAMES6320FinalProject.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            My final project for this class was to create a simple game that mimicked some aspects of The Legend of Zelda series. My time was limited so I
            proved various concepts rather than fleshing out any individual concept. The player can move a character around the screen with some simple animations.
            When the player collides with items (the hearts) they are hidden, which with a small amount of additional work could be changed to "collecting" them.
            When the player collides with enemies they are knocked back. The player can press the space bar to swing a sword. If the sword collides with enemies 
            they are hidden. When the player moves off the screen to the right or left, the current scene is unloaded (all objects not marked as persistent are destroyed)
            and a new scene is loaded based on the direction the player has moved. The player is also moved to the opposite side of the screen to make it look more like they 
            are coming from that direction. 
            <br/><br/>
            To create this project I used a simple C++ game engine that was provided to me. Throughout this class I fleshed out the graphics system and created a scene system.
            I also used animation and collision systems that were created by other students. The game uses 3D meshes, but the meshes I use are all flat because the animation 
            system I used came with a tool that lets me easily create flat meshes.
            <br/><br/>
            I was interested in this because I've been thinking a lot about how games like the classic Zelda games would load and use data as the 
            player moves between screens. I've also been thinking about modern games that often have seamless worlds. While I created my scene system with the capabilities of 
            doing level streaming, I didn't have time to implement level streaming for this project. However, even this simple project revealed some interesting things about 
            the complexities of loading and unloading data in games. For example, my scene system can load and unload objects very simply, but when this is combined with 
            other systems that need to know information about scene objects it can get more complicated quickly. The collision system in particular had certain expectations about 
            how collisions would be set up that required me to load and unload scenes differently than I expected. If I was to move forward and create more systems for this 
            game and adjust the existing systems, I would want to design everything with easy loading in mind.
        </p>

        <h2>My Experience Making This</h2>
        <h3>My Systems</h3>
        <p class="image-description">
            Using my scene system worked about as well as I expected it to. I knew that I wanted to do something like this project while I was creating my system, so I 
            designed it partially with that in mind. I had already created a sample scene object that I built on to fulfill the rest of my needs, which made my task a lot 
            easier. The majority of my work in this project was integrating the other systems and creating game logic. 
            <br/><br/>
            One thing that I would want to change is to 
            have integrated managers for most if not all object types, especially in the graphics system. For example, if two objects use the same mesh it gets loaded multiple times. If I had some sort of mesh 
            manager that received the request to load a mesh, then it could check if we already have that mesh loaded and use that instead of loading a new mesh. I created managers 
            for enemies and items because of how my scene system holds objects. With my system I'm able to search for all objects of a type or search by object ID, 
            but this part of system is inconvenient to use, is slow, and doesn't make it easy to work with all objects of a type across many different places. My item and enemy managers could 
            hold references to all active items or enemies and also handle some logic, such as when an object should be rendered. This removes a lot of effort on my part. Rather than needing to 
            manage several objects and handle their logic individually, I can make a call to a manager that will handle the logic for all of them at once. I think expanding this 
            to other parts of my engine, or perhaps creating a base manager that holds some basic functionality would make creating and handling future objects easier.
            <br/><br/>
            One thing that was inconvenient about my system that I would want to fix is to find some way to make it easier to load derived classes in the scene system. I had to 
            duplicate a lot of code in the static load functions that the system uses. I have a renderable object that is the parent of a collision object. Because the load function 
            needs to allocate memory for the object that is being loaded, I couldn't just call the parent's load function because it would allocate memory for the wrong object type.
            This might not be a system issue, for example I could have static functions like LoadMeshAndEffect() that could be used by the renderable object along with the collision object. 
            Regardless, using the load functions wasn't particularly difficult, but I think there should be an easier way to create them. Ideally if we used a GameObject/Component system, 
            we could set up the scene system to load individual components and create some object types by simply combining components with different attributes. This still leaves the problem 
            of creating load functions for components, but it could potentially simplify the process of creating load functions for more complex objects.
            <br/><br/>
            Another thing that I still want to find a better solution for is searching for objects in my scenes. I can search for all objects of a type, and I can search for an object with a 
            specific ID, but it's not convenient. After finding objects the user still needs to do error checking and casting. I could create some sort of template function that performs 
            the cast that is required, and that would help in the process. The biggest thing that I would want to figure out is how to search for specific objects without giving every 
            object a name. One option is to find a way to replace names with some other data at compile time (so each name could be replaced by an object ID or something), but that sounds 
            overly complicated. To some extent I probably just need to accept that users need to provide their own criteria for how to differentiate between objects. In this game I got 
            around this search issue in two ways. First, items and enemies add themselves to the appropriate manager when they are created. So I never have to search for them because I 
            don't need to deal with any item or enemy specifically. The second way is that I made sure some objects were unique in their scenes. The background for each scene is the only renderable 
            object, so I just need to search for that type and I know I'll just get the background. The character is the same, but the character persists between scenes so I only ever need to find 
            it when the game first initializes. And for the character I could have also created a character manager similar to how the items and enemies work, but the game is simple enough for now 
            that it seemed unnecessary.
        </p>
        <h3>Others' Systems</h3>
        <p class="image-description">
            Working with the systems that other students created was mostly good, but I ran into different problems with both of them. I think this was somewhat inevitable given that they 
            had no way of knowing my requirements for their systems. I had to make minor adjustments to both systems. 
            <br/><br/>
            Integrating both systems into my engine was really easy. The interfaces were clear, and it was easy and fast to get something simple cases working. 
            For the collision system specifically, it was easy to add collision components to objects through the inheritance structure that I was previously using for scene objects. 
            After creating my collision objects, it worked great, but I needed to make a few changes. I needed to know what type of object I was colliding with in order for the sword 
            to defeat enemies, for the player to get knocked back by enemies, and for the player to pick up the items. My scene objects already had an object type ID, so I added this to 
            the collision component so that I could use that in my game. One problem that I was unable to solve is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to "teleport" a collider.
            In my game I move the player to the other side of the screen whenever they move to a new scene, but in the process the player can still run into enemies and receive knockback 
            in their new location. This is more a problem with the creator of the system not knowing what my requirements would be. Normally this is actually a really good feature to 
            make sure that fast-moving objects still detect collisions, and it works very well for that purpose. 
            <br/><br/>
            The main issue I ran into with the collision system was a unique interaction between it and my scene system. The collision manager does not expect many colliders to be added 
            and removed at once. Because of that, a bug arose where new colliders could get removed. The old colliders were gone and no longer existed, but the collision manager hadn't been updated,
            so it still thought that it needed to remove some colliders. 
            I got around it by unloading a scene (and thus removing all colliders), making a new 
            collision manager, and only then loading a new scene. Another solution to this might have been to have a collision manager for each scene. 
            It is probably possible to get around this issue in multiple ways. If I were to move forward with this project, I would dig into the collision system more to find 
            a cleaner solution to this issue to hopefully avoid any future problems.
            I'm really glad that I ran into this bug because it showed me that there can be a lot more complexity to loading and unloading objects than what I have handled. 
            I would be really interested to figure out how to best integrate loading for situations like this into my scene system.
            <br/><br/>
            Despite some issues that I ran into, using this collision system was a good experience. As stated previously, it did its job really well. It just didn't match some unique 
            requirements that I had.
            <br/><br/>
            Using the animation system was similarly a good experience, but also required some changes. The hardest part was that I was unaware of the fact that after an animation is complete 
            it would revert back to the Idle state, where I expected it to just stop at its last frame until I changed the state. This resulted in some bugs, but once I was aware of the problem
            it was easy to fix. I also had an issue where on initialization, animation objects would allocate memory up to the maximum amount of animation data. However, the way it did this 
            caused the build to crash in Release mode for animations that only used a small amount of animation data. This wasn't a particularly difficult fix though. One thing that would 
            have been helpful to me when using the system would be to allow me to pass in the maximum amount of animation data rather than having that tied to a constant in the animation system.
            I needed to expand the maximum from what I first set it to, but I had forgotten that I had set it in the first place and it was hard to track it to that issue.
            <br/><br/>
            Using the mesh creation tool that came with the system was convenient for smaller meshes, but for larger meshes it was hard to tell exactly which pixel I was coloring and was 
            less precise (which is why I left holes in the sun in my backgrounds). But the fact that it came with a mesh creation tool at all was very appreciated.

        <h2>What I learned This Semester</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            This semester has been extremely useful to me as a programmer. I usually don't have many issues with any one particular task, but I've often struggled in combining 
            complex systems. The biggest thing I've learned in this class is system design. I've practiced keeping systems independent, doing user/results-focused design, and focusing on a 
            budget (in my case it was usually development time rather than compute or memory, but I also tried to minimize memory usage where possible). Getting this practice has helped me a lot in knowing 
            when and how to use different design patterns, like singletons. It's helped me realize that the reason that we learn design patterns isn't because they're the perfect fit 
            for every situation, but because we need to know a lot of options before we can get a sense of what is a good fit for a particular situation. I created my scene system with 
            my project in mind. Because of that it was generally really easy to use and worked for my situation. Other systems weren't designed with my game in mind and they didn't 
            always cover my situation perfectly. That doesn't mean these were bad systems, it just means that I either need to adapt my project or change the system. And seeing how 
            others solved their design problems was really informative in helping me realize how I could improve my own system. 
            <br/><br/>
            I think that this was the main purpose of designing a 
            system and using that system along with others' systems to make a game. I need to create a system to get more practice in that area, and I need exposure to more systems 
            and design patterns to improve my own. I really like how this class gave us some guidance in building up one system (while still giving us freedom to make significant design
            decisions), and then set us free to make our own. I think we were meant to see the complexity that a system can have along with possible solutions to those problems. Then, 
            we need to just do it. In my Computer Science education I spent a lot of time learning design patterns and implementing large projects, but I didn't get a lot of practice 
            in designing my own systems. It was usually practiced in prescribed ways. Being able to conceive of and make my own system with the knowledge I've gained was really valuable. 
            And going on to use my system along with others was helpful in putting my design to the test and seeing the flaws in it. Using other systems helped me get more exposure 
            to design ideas and it also helped me see some shortcomings of my system. 
            <br/><br/>
            After this project, I've definitely started to develop more of a personal preference for how I want to handle architecture and design. If I try to spend too much time designing 
            up front a lot of it is wasted as I get into the code and realize what limitations I'm facing. But if I just design as I go then a lot of time is wasted trying to work around 
            a problem before I ultimately need to refactor. What I settled on in the end for this project was to periodically create a framework for what I would work on next. I had a set 
            of requirements for my scene system, which was my initial framework. I figured out where to start and fleshed out the framework a little more in that area before implementing it.
            Then, I went back to the requirements to flesh out the next bit of framework that I needed to make sure I wasn't making silly mistakes halfway through implementation, and so on.
            Doing this didn't solve all of my problems, and having a solid architecture from the beginning probably would have been better, but with my level of experience I need to 
            get into the code so that I can see what problems I'm facing early on. I hope that as I improve in my skills I'll be able to anticipate more problems in advance to be 
            able to spend even less time refactoring after running into problems. 
            <br/><br/>
            As far as designing things to be flexible up front vs designing for only what is needed in that moment, I think there is value to both approaches based on the situation. 
            For example, if you are creating a system for an annual project or for several projects at once, it's probably best to design something more flexible. But if you're 
            just working on one game that needs a new system, you should probably just develop the system for that game. That being said, it's important that in designing a system it
            still works independent of other parts of the code as much as possible. Furthermore, if there is something that's easy to add to provide flexibility and has a low overhead
            cost, you might as well add it. In my case I didn't think that I'd be able to get around to implementing level streaming in my final project, but I knew that it would be 
            really easy to implement with how the rest of my scene system was set up. Because of that, I added the option in. I didn't flesh it out as much as I could have though, because
            I doubted that a more fleshed-out use case would be necessary.
            <br/><br/>
            To me there are a few big things that make software architecture good. One is that wherever possible it shouldn't require an in-depth understanding of the inner workings of the system.
            A big reason that we create software and different systems is so that not everyone needs to specialize in the same things and we can divide up the work. Needing a base 
            level knowledge of the system is alright, but if you have to understand all the implementation details then there's a lot of wasted time in learning that before the 
            system is useful. Another thing that makes good design is that it should work independently of other systems wherever possible. For example, I tried my best to make sure 
            that my scene system was independent from as many systems as possible. It ended up relying on the physics system because it used rigidbodies for position, but really it 
            probably should have even been independent from that. This made it a lot easier to use. In the end the collision and scene systems didn't work in a way that made them easily 
            independent, but if they had been designed in such a way that they did not interfere with each other it would have saved a lot of time. A third thing that I think makes 
            good software design is a clear and convenient interface. Ideally I'd like to call a few functions, pass in some data, and have the system take care of everything else 
            for me. The less that I have to do to use the system properly the better. Also, systems and software should fail gracefully. They shouldn't cause a program to crash 
            and if they do have errors it should be easy to find out what they are. Finally, software should fulfill the needs of the user. That was the biggest problem with the collision 
            system for me. With my scene system I frequently load and unload many objects, and the collision system wasn't prepared for that. That doesn't mean it's a bad system, but 
            it wasn't the best system for my game. 
            <br/><br/>
            I'm excited to take what I've learned here and apply it in various ways while I continue to develop games. This was a big weak point for me and I'm glad that it isn't 
            nearly as much of a problem anymore.
