            For my final project I'd like to make the beginnings of a simple top-down Zelda style game. I will have a character that moves around. 
            When a button is pressed an object will appear that represents the player's sword, and it will disappear again after a certain amount of time. 
            When the sword hits certain other objects they will be destroyed. Some other objects will be destroyed ("picked up") when the player walks over them. 
            I will use my scene system in one of two ways: either I'll load a new scene when all destructable objects are destroyed or when the player moves off screen. 
            The one I choose depends on how much time I have available. I'd like to change scenes when the player moves off screen, but I could see that being difficult 
            depending on how the rest of the game goes. This is the core of the game. After collisions and scenes, a stretch goal is to apply a knockback force when the 
            player walks into unfriendly objects. As a final stretch goal, I want to use Ssu-Fan (Alice) Wang's animation system to create and animate sprites for the player 
            and all objects. The player will walk and swing a sword, and enemies will have a simple idle animation. There will be no AI, score, inventory tracking, or win or lose state. 
            <br/><br/>
            I do not have a link for Alice's animation system and I don't have names or links for either of the collision systems. I will make sure to include links and full names 
            in my final write up.
