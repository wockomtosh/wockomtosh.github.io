            For my engine system I'm planning to make a scene/level representation and provide the ability to load and stream scenes/levels. So far in the games I've worked on
            one of the things that I've really enjoyed is handling the overall flow of the game. I've also been interested in how certain games provide large seamless worlds. 
            In particular I've been thinking about the differences between older top-down Zelda games and modern top-down Zelda games, so I want to provide a system that will allow 
            users to create sections of a world that can be loaded in next to each other based on certain conditions (like the camera's position). 
            <br/><br/>
            My current idea of how this will work from the perspective of a user is that the user will be able to create a .scene file in which they can store objects. These objects 
            can contain certain information like a position, and the user will optionally be able to implement functions like OnSceneLoaded(). There will be a function called LoadScene() 
            which will let the user load in a new scene. There will also be a function called StreamScene() which will allow the player to load in an additional scene at a given location. 
            I'm not yet sure how the .scene files will be created. I think I won't have time to make an editor in which the user can move objects around, so they may need to be edited by hand 
            to start. 
            <br/><br/>
            I think a major challenge will be figuring out how to allow the player to store any object inside of the scene. I may need to create a GameObject representation that is required. 
            In another class we implemented an entity component system that allowed us to attach any component to any game object. I may need to create a simplified system like that if things 
            get too complicated. I'll definitely need to figure out something for that. When I load a scene with objects I'll also need to make sure to load all the appropriate meshes and 
            shaders and things like that, which could get tricky. If that gets too complicated I might need to make the .scene file have an object representation, but then have the user assign 
            objects to those representations at runtime. That sounds really cumbersome though, so I'll try not to. I think scene streaming is a stretch goal, and just getting a scene representation 
            that can be loaded is the main goal. Also if I find a way to make an editor that won't take too long then I could try that as well.
