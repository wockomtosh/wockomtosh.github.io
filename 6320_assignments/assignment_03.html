            This is assignment 3 for GAMES6320. In this assignment I learned more about refactoring code, making design decisions for 
            systems, and creating platform-independent code. The main focus of this assignment was to take our Graphics.platform.cpp files
            and combine them into one completely platform-independent Graphics.cpp file. A second focus was to make our mesh and effect representations
            more flexible by allowing them to be initialized with custom data rather than having everything hard-coded. 
            <br/><br/>
            To make Graphics.cpp platform-independent I created a function library called GraphicsBuffers. The platform-specific differences between
            OpenGL and D3D were mostly focused around how the different buffers were treated. They cleared the frame and depth buffers differently and 
            swapped the back buffer differently. So I made three functions: ClearFrameBuffer() that takes in a color to be the clear color,
            ClearDepthBuffer(), and SwapBackBuffer(). All of the platform specific code went into .cpp files for the GraphicsBuffer. The problem with this 
            implementation was that D3D uses views in some of these steps. I couldn't find an equivalent representation of views for OpenGL, so I decided 
            to keep my view representation purely behind D3D. However, views need to be initialized and cleaned up, so I created Initialize() and CleanUp() functions for my 
            GraphicsBuffers function library. This worked well. I could have also made a View interface that would be used in Graphics.cpp, but I had a hard time 
            figuring out how to pass those views into GraphicsBuffers in a way that didn't feel wrong to me, so I just put it on the D3D side. I still don't completely
            like my current implementation because the Initialize() and CleanUp() GraphicsBuffers functions are just empty on the OpenGL implementation, but 
            I couldn't come up with something better. After finishing this, Graphics.cpp was completely platform-independent. I also created a Color struct 
            that makes passing around colors a little bit easier, but it doesn't have any platform-specific differences.
            Currently it's only used for setting the clear color. 
            <br/><br/>
            Setting up effects to not have hard-coded data was pretty trivial, but doing the same for meshes was much harder. The biggest reason 
            for this is that I did not properly understand how index buffers are supposed to work. My initial implementation required the user to pass in 
            their vertex data with information about every triangle, and then I just set the index data to match that. However, after some conversations 
            with a friend who knew more (shoutout to Gabe) and additional explanation in class, I fixed this so that the user is required to pass in index buffer 
            data in addition to vertex data. Aside from this, I ran into a lot of issues that resulted from not understanding how the data was used. 
            For example, I didn't realize at first that I needed to separate the vertex and index buffer pointers in D3D to be member variables. This made it so that 
            when I tried to draw 2 meshes only one appeared, because I was trying to initialize 2 meshes into the same place. Once I realized the issue this wasn't 
            a complicated fix.

            This is my code that clears the back buffer and fills it with a clear color that is passed in. In this case I'm using a dark green.

        <img src="images\InitEffect.png" alt="Initializing an effect">
        <p class="image-description">
            To initialize an effect the user needs to specify the names of the shaders they want to use. They can specify fragment and vertex shaders.  
            Both kinds of shaders default to standard.shader. 
        </p>

        <img src="images\EffectData.png" alt="Effect data">
        <p class="image-description">
            Here is the list of member variables stored in my Effect. The name of the shader doesn't need to be stored as long as we 
            have pointers to our vertex shader and fragment shader representations. For OpenGL we also need a programId. 
            For D3D the sizeof() function returns 48, while in OpenGL it returns 16. While it may seem that OpenGL should be larger because of the 
            programId, the implementation of cRenderState for D3D makes the D3D version much larger. It holds 3 pointers in the D3D implementation
            that aren't present in OpenGL. Additionally, because OpenGL is running in the x86 platform the pointers are 4 bytes instead of 8 which makes a big difference. 
            The effect can't be any smaller because we have to have some way of referencing our shaders and the render state for each effect (and the programId for OpenGL).
            If any of these are shared between effects they will not work properly.

        <img src="images\MeshInit.png" alt="Initializing a mesh">
        <p class="image-description">
            To initialize a mesh the user needs to specify the number of triangles, the vertex data, and the index buffer data.
            In this case the index data and vertex data are very simple, but for my rectangle mesh I only pass in 4 vertices with 
            6 indices to allow users to not need to redefine vertices in their data.

        <p class="image-description">
            Because the necessary data has several differences between OpenGL and D3D, I decided to store that data in a struct and 
            define the struct differently in each .cpp file. By doing this I didn't need to include any D3D or OpenGL files in the header, 
            only in the .cpp files. Both implementations need a number of triangles that is used when drawing.
            OpenGL needs an ID for the vertex buffer, vertex array, and index buffer. D3D needs a pointer each for the vertex format, 
            vertex buffer, and index buffer. Both implementations hold a pointer to this struct rather than holding an instance 
            of the struct. The OpenGL implementation has a size of 8 because of the 32 bit unsigned int and a 32 bit pointer. 
            D3D has a size of 16 because of the 64 bit unsigned int and a 64 bit pointer. If the struct wasn't a pointer, the two 
            platforms would be more similar in size. D3D would be larger if using 64 bit pointers, but with 32 bit pointers it would be the 
            same size, since the size of GLuint is 32 bits. None of this information can be removed while still defining a mesh. We might 
            be able to remove the number of triangles and calculate that using the index data, but that information would still need to be 
            stored unless we wanted to store the index data directly, which would take much more space.
