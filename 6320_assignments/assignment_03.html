        <p class="image-description">
            This is my code that clears the back buffer and fills it with a clear color that is passed in. In this case I'm using a dark green.

            This is my game running with a dark green background rather than a black background.

        <img src="images\InitEffect.png" alt="Initializing an effect">
        <p class="image-description">
            To initialize an effect the user needs to specify the names of the shaders they want to use. They can specify fragment and vertex shaders.  
            Both kinds of shaders default to standard.shader. 
        </p>

        <img src="images\EffectData.png" alt="Effect data">
        <p class="image-description">
            Here is the list of member variables stored in my Effect. The name of the shader doesn't need to be stored as long as we 
            have pointers to our vertex shader and fragment shader representations. For OpenGL we also need a programId. 
            For D3D the sizeof() function returns 48, while in OpenGL it returns 16. While it may seem that OpenGL should be larger because of the 
            programId, the implementation of cRenderState for D3D makes the D3D version much larger. It holds 3 pointers in the D3D implementation
            that aren't present in OpenGL. Additionally, because OpenGL is running in the x86 platform the pointers are 4 bytes instead of 8 which makes a big difference. 
            The effect can't be any smaller because we have to have some way of referencing our shaders and the render state for each effect (and the programId for OpenGL).
            If any of these are shared between effects they will not work properly. 
        </p>

        <img src="images\MeshInit.png" alt="Initializing a mesh">
        <p class="image-description">
            To initialize a mesh the user needs to specify the number of triangles, the vertex data, and the index buffer data.
            In this case the index data and vertex data are very simple, but for my rectangle mesh I only pass in 4 vertices with 
            6 indices to allow users to not need to redefine vertices in their data.

        <p class="image-description">
            Because the necessary data has several differences between OpenGL and D3D, I decided to store that data in a struct and 
            define the struct differently in each .cpp file. Both implementations need a number of triangles that is used when drawing.
            OpenGL needs an ID for the vertex buffer, vertex array, and index buffer. D3D needs a pointer each for the vertex format, 
            vertex buffer, and index buffer. Both implementations hold a pointer to this struct rather than holding an instance 
            of the struct. The OpenGL implementation has a size of 8 because of the 32 bit unsigned int and a 32 bit pointer. 
            D3D has a size of 16 because of the 64 bit unsigned int and a 64 bit pointer. If the struct wasn't a pointer, the two 
            platforms would be more similar in size. D3D would be larger if using 64 bit pointers, but with 32 bit pointers it would be the 
            same size, since the size of GLuint is 32 bits. None of this information can be removed while still defining a mesh. We might 
            be able to remove the number of triangles and calculate that using the index data, but that information would still need to be 
            stored unless we wanted to store the index data directly, which would take much more space.
