            This is assignment 8 for GAMES6320. In this assignment I updated my meshbuilder to convert my human-readable Lua files to 
            binary files to be used at runtime. This was a pretty quick change other than changing some of my error handling. I also 
            needed to reverse the winding order for OpenGL triangles at build time, but this wasn't too difficult. This was the easiest 
            assignment so far, but even so it was really cool to see how beneficial binary files are, and also how surprisingly easy they 
            are to work with. The Lua files, while convenient for error-checking, were hard to extract and deal with in code.

            This is one of my binary mesh files. The order of the data is the number of vertices, followed by the number of triangles, 
            then the vertex data followed by the index data. I chose this order because I knew that the number of vertices and indices 
            would be used to extract the vertex and index data, and putting all of the small data up front seemed easier to read in a hex editor. 
            It also ended up aligning very nicely in the hex editor. The number of vertices is highlighted in green, and is 4 in this case. 
            The number of triangles is highlighted in yellow and there are two. The vertex data has two parts, the location of the vertex and the 
            vertex color. Each location value is stored as a float, so there are 12 bytes total for x, y, and z. This is highlighted in blue.
            The color value, highlighted in magenta, is stored as 1 byte each for r, g, b, and a. The index data is at the end and each index is stored 
            in 2 bytes. Highlighted in orange is the first triangle with indices of 0, 1, and 2. 
            <br/><br/>
            These binary files take up much less memory than the human-readable files and are also much faster to load at runtime. These are the primary 
            reasons that we use binary files at runtime. A human isn't using them, so we only care about memory and processing efficiency. 
            We store human-readable formats in source control because then they can be adjusted and used by the developers more easily. 
            <br/><br/>
            This particular binary file was build for D3D. D3D and OpenGL use different winding orders for indices, so when I build a binary file 
            for OpenGL the first and last index of each triangle are flipped. This lets me move the processing power for that change to build time rather 
            than runtime, which lets the game load faster.

            This is how I extract the data from a binary mesh file. It's 4 small blocks of code for the 4 data points that I need. I need to allocate 
            memory for the vertex and index data and copy the data over because if I just point them to the location of the loaded binary file, 
            and then I free that data, the memory is no longer safe. For the vertex and triangle count this wasn't necessary.

            To test the advantages of using binary files I created a helix with many vertices. My first helix in Maya said it has around 65,000 vertices,
            though in the human-readable file it was somewhere around 200,000. So I had to reduce it to about 16,000 vertices to get about 64,000 in the 
            human-readable file. The human-readable file is 18,934 KB, while the binary file is only 1,189 KB. That's a massive difference in memory, 
            which would be helpful in a game with many assets. The binary file is about 6% the size of the human-readable file.
            The human-readable helix mesh file takes 0.73 seconds to load and extract. Meanwhile, the binary file takes .001 seconds to load and extract.
            That's an even bigger savings than the memory. Clearly binary files are much more efficient than verbose human-readable text files.
