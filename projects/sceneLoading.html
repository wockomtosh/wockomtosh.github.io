            This contains the scene project, SceneBuilder.exe, and an example scene file. I also included the SceneBuilder project in case the executable is hard to use.

        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        <img class="clamp-wide-image" src="../6320_assignments/images\SceneHeaderFile.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            The scene system allows you to organize objects into scenes and load/unload those scenes as one unit. This makes it easier to organize your world
            and manage level flow. It can also be used for level streaming or loading in a group of objects all at once. The scene system keeps a list of loaded 
            scenes along with a list of persistent scene objects (which will be explained more later). 
            <br/>
            The core of the scene system is loading and unloading scenes. The LoadNewScene function will unload all existing scenes and load in a new one. 
            The LoadAdditionalScene function loads a new scene without unloading any other scenes. UnloadSceneByID unloads a particular scene. 
            The system provides several functions for searching scene objects. These include searching by object ID, scene ID, type, and searching for persistent objects.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a scene?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            A scene is composed of Scene Objects. cSceneObject is an abstract class that can be used to allow objects to be loaded as part of a scene. All scene objects have 
            an ID, a type, and whether they are persistent between scenes. Persistent scene objects will not be unloaded by the scene system. When a persistent object is loaded 
            as part of a scene, it is added to a separate list of persistent scene objects. In addition to these properties, scene objects have a virtual function that can be implemented 
            called OnSceneLoaded, which is called by the system after all scene objects have loaded.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I make a scene object?</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            To implement a scene object, you need to create a class that inherits from cSceneObject. Then, you need to implement a static Load function (an example is shown below).
            This function tells the scene system how to treat your derived scene object class. This function should allocate memory for your scene object and load and set up any 
            additional data needed for your object. It is passed a map of additional data. This data is set up in the scene file, and can contain anything the user wants. The intention 
            is for the additional data to contain file paths or other small pieces of information necessary to instantiate your class. This load function could also be used to 
            store a reference to these objects in a manager or some other place in your code. For example, I could store all renderable objects in a list somewhere and add them to 
            that list whenever one is loaded here.
        </p>

        <h2>How do I make a scene file?</h2>
        <img class="clamp-wide-image" src="../6320_assignments/images\FinalSceneObject.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            A scene file consists of a list of scene objects. Each scene object is required to have a type and any additional data necessary for that object. Each scene object 
            can optionally have a position, orientation, and whether it is persistent between scenes. By default they will have a 0 position and orientation and will not be persistent.
            The type is a uint16_t that is used by the system to know which load function to use for that object. I recommend storing this as a static member of the class you create.
            The types are set by the user. Any additional data is stored as a list of pairs of strings. Anything can theoretically be stored here, but it is recommended to keep it short.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How do I use it in my game?</h2>
        <img class="clamp-wide-image" src="../6320_assignments/images\InGameUse.png">
        <p class="image-description">
            To use this system in your game, first you need to implement your scene objects. Then you should initialize and cleanup the system when your game initializes and cleans up.
            When you initialize your game you should also register your load functions. To do this you pass in your object type along with the static load function to the scene system.
            After that is done you can load a scene and search for scene objects in whatever way fits your use case.
        </p>

        <h2>Potential improvements</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            There are a lot of potential improvements that could be made to this system, many of which require other systems. For example, a file lookup system that uses GUIDs would 
            be helpful in auto-generating the scene files and allowing file paths to be represented by a GUID rather than a string. If path names get too long it negatively affects performance 
            because it increases file size and file read time. For very small projects that only require simple scenes and simple scene objects this isn't an issue. But as 
            scenes and objects become more complex this would quickly balloon to unmanageable levels. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Another improvement would be to create and integrate a component system so that more complicated scene objects can easily be created. The user could then add components 
            to a scene object rather than inheriting from a cSceneObject. The inheritance structure does its job well, but if it is the only mechanism for creating unique objects then it will
            create a complicated tree of objects that is hard to navigate. If this was integrated with a component system, then the components would likely use their own Load functions  
            that would be called by the cSceneObject Load function. Users would be able to create new scene objects by composition rather than inheritance, or they could 
            create some objects through inheritance and variations on those objects through composition.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            An additional improvement to the system would be a better way to search for objects in the scene. One option for this would be to store a name for each scene object and provide a lookup 
            using that name, but I didn't want to store the extra data needed for that. One way that I was able to mitigate this problem when using this system was to store a reference to 
            scene objects in their respective systems. For example, if the user creates an enemy object, when an enemy object is loaded a pointer to that enemy can be stored in an enemy manager,
            which can then easily handle whatever needs to be done with the enemy. The main problem with this is that it is a user-side solution. Perhaps there is a way to create this type of manager 
            as part of a different system, and the user can then extend the managers to suit their needs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Probably the most useful improvement would be a scene editor that allows the user to manipulate objects in the scene and auto-generate the scene files rather than requiring the user 
            to create scene files by hand. No matter how user-friendly the rest of the system is in helping the user manage scenes in code, without a scene editor this system is too cumbersome to use
            for a game with any real complexity.
