        <h2 id="movement">Movement Behaviors</h2>

        <p class="image-description">
            I implemented various dynamic steering behaviors for this engine. The behaviors available are: Seek, Arrive, Align, Velocity Match, Evade, Separate, Wander, and Flocking.
            This writeup assumes a basic understanding of how these behavior algorithms work.

            The beginning of this project involved a lot more setup than I anticipated. Not only did I need to get basic AI movement working, I also had to figure out what sort 
            of architecture I wanted to use to run my AI system. 
            Luckily, I was learning about engine architecture in a class I was taking at the time so I decided to combine a lot of what I learned in that class into this project. 
            While doing that, I learned that some of the things from my engine class were unnecessary for the goals of this project, so I didn't end up putting all of my 
            engine code into this project. I wanted to take advantage of certain features from my engine, but I didn't want to include certain other features that would cause bloat. 
            It was very interesting to learn first-hand how to set up this sort of project and how to tell what will be useful to me and what won't. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I also learned several important lessons about good programming practice. One is that I need to be careful to use good variable names. I had issues early on because I was using less descriptive variable names 
            which caused me to introduce several bugs. I also didn't understand certain algorithms thoroughly enough. For example, I technically implemented Seek incorrectly. 
            I multiplied max acceleration by the distance vector to the target, which leads to an implicit increase in acceleration based on the distance to the target. 
            Also, my code that clamped the max acceleration didn't actually work. I didn't realize the issue until my Seek output was disproportionately large in the flocking algorithm. 
            It still looked good though, and I like the outcome more than doing it "correctly." Therefore, I kept it and desinged the rest of my algorithms with that 
            assumption rather than fixing it. This was a big learning experience though. The way that the incorrect Seek looks is what I initially expected, but is not accurate to 
            the algorithm. This came up several times. I either understood the algorithm of a behavior but got an unexpected output, or I got output that I liked but the algorithm 
            wasn't correct. In the former case I was able to change parameters to give a better outcome, but in the latter case I instead needed to spend time debugging and making 
            sure that everything was correct.
