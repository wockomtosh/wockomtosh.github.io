        <h2>Controller Programming</h2>
        <img class="standalone-image" src="..\images\ControllerSetup.jpg" alt="Controller Picture">
        <p class="image-description">
            To use a seesaw as a controller we attached an Arduino Nano 33 IoT to the center of the seesaw along with a button on each side.
            I programmed the Arduino to read the angle of the seesaw along with the on/off state of the buttons. 
            That data is encoded into a 5-digit string and sent over the serial port 10 times per second. 
            This frequency was initially meant to be a placeholder value, but after testing there didn't seem to be 
            any issues with the frequency of the input, so I kept it at 10 Hz.
            We initially used an Arduino Mega 2560 with an attached module, but switched to the Nano.
            This was because the Mega 2560 was less consistent in giving the correct output. The Mega 2560 still works, but the Nano works better.
            We also considered using the Bluetooth functionality of the Nano, but it was cut to save time as well as reduce input latency.

        <h2>Processing Controller Inputs</h2>
        <p class="image-description">
            To process the controller inputs in Unreal we needed a way to read from a serial COM port. Initially, we hoped to use the 
            <a href="https://github.com/videofeedback/Unreal_Engine_SerialCOM_Plugin/releases">Unreal Engine SerialCOM Plugin</a> but 
            we had issues with creating a build when that plugin was installed. There wasn't anything wrong with how the plugin functioned in the game,
            so I wrote some code to mimic the functionality. I made sure that I thoroughly understood how the serial communication works for our use case. 
            Throughout the development of the game we discussed adding more features to the controller, and I wanted to be prepared to make adjustments 
            to how we handled serial communication if necessary. 
            So while I could have just copied parts of the SerialCOM plugin, I decided to instead use it as a reference. I created a repository for testing purposes
            that can be found <a href="https://github.com/wockomtosh/UnrealSerialCom/tree/main">here</a>. It contains links to the resources I used along with test code.
            While testing and creating this code, I learned that I did not need to use all of the features that were available in the SerialCOM plugin, so my code 
            only contains a few features that were necessary for our game.
