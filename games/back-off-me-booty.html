        <h2>Controller Details</h2>
        <h3>Controller Programming</h3>
        <img class="standalone-image" src="..\images\ControllerSetup.jpg" alt="Controller Picture">
        <p class="image-description">
            To use a seesaw as a controller we attached an Arduino Nano 33 IoT to the center of the seesaw along with a button on each side.
            I programmed the Arduino to read the angle of the seesaw along with the on/off state of the buttons. 
            That data is encoded into a 5-digit string and sent over the serial port 10 times per second. 
            This frequency was initially meant to be a placeholder value, but after processing the inputs there didn't seem to be 
            any issues with the frequency, so I kept it at 10 Hz.
            We initially used an Arduino Mega 2560 with an attached module, but switched to the Nano.
            This was because the Mega 2560 was less consistent in giving the correct output. The Mega 2560 still works, but the Nano works better.
            We also considered using the Bluetooth functionality of the Nano, but it was cut to save time as well as reduce input latency.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Processing Controller Inputs</h3>
        <p class="image-description">
            To process the controller inputs in Unreal we needed a way to read from a serial COM port. Initially, we hoped to use the 
            <a href="https://github.com/videofeedback/Unreal_Engine_SerialCOM_Plugin/releases">Unreal Engine SerialCOM Plugin</a> but 
            we had issues with creating a build when that plugin was installed. There wasn't anything wrong with how the plugin functioned in the game,
            so I wrote some code to mimic the functionality. I made sure that I thoroughly understood how the serial communication works for our use case. 
            Throughout the development of the game we discussed adding more features to the controller, and I wanted to be prepared to make adjustments 
            to how we handled serial communication if necessary. 
            So while I could have just copied parts of the SerialCOM plugin, I decided to instead use it as a reference. I created a repository for testing purposes
            that can be found <a href="https://github.com/wockomtosh/UnrealSerialCom/tree/main">here</a>. It contains links to the resources I used along with test code.
            While testing and creating this code, I learned that I did not need to use all of the features that were available in the SerialCOM plugin, so my code 
            only contains a few features that were necessary for our game.

        <p class="image-description">
            We can use this code in a blueprint to easily open a serial port. When our Arduino is plugged into a computer the COM port that it uses varies from machine to machine.
            To avoid requiring us to check which port the Arduino is using, I used a for loop that checks ports 1 through 10 for a device and returns once a port is opened.
            This requires us to make sure that no other devices are connected to a COM port with a lower number than the Arduino, but this was rarely an issue for us.
            After a connection with the Arduino is established, the input read loop starts.
        </p>

        <img class="standalone-image" src="..\images\BOMBInputLoop.png" alt="Read Input Loop Blueprint">
        <p class="image-description">
            The input read loop reads a line from the serial port, checks that it is a valid input, and then parses that input to be used elsewhere in the player controller.
            The read loop is simple at its core, but inconsistencies in the Arduino's output require accounting for some edge cases. These edge cases were reduced 
            when we switched from the Arduino Mega 2560 to the Arduino Nano 33 IoT, but the code was still useful to keep in place so that either device could be used.
            The most important edge case was that occasionally the Arduino will output the data in two separate lines or it will output partial data. In this situation we 
            flush the port and try again. If there are too many failures we close the port and reopen it to try to fix the problem. This was initially necessary for an early 
            version of the Arduino code in which the Arduino would crash due to a memory leak that I had missed. Resetting the port would reset the Arduino and fix the problem.
        </p>

        <h3>Smoothing Rotation</h3>
        <img class="standalone-image" src="..\images\AlignAlgorithm.png" alt="Align algorithm code">
        <p class="image-description">
            The input is constantly checked on the controller so that the game is synced up with the tilt of the seesaw. However, if we set the angle of the ship to match the 
            angle of the seesaw directly the result is choppy. The options available to fix this were to increase the frequency of the input or use an algorithm to 
            produce a smoother result. Because of the inconsistencies that the Arduino produced at 10 Hz, there were already  occasional stutters and mistakes in the angle of the ship.
            Using a higher frequency would still result in stutters when an input is sent incorrectly. So I decided to first try a smoothing algorithm. 
            I used a Dynamic Align algorithm to achieve this. This algorithm does not modify the angle of the ship directly, but rather outputs an angular acceleration to 
            smoothly reach our desired position. The algorithm is given current orientation, current rotation speed, and a target orientation, along with other 
            properties that tune the movement behavior. We use a slow radius to determine when we should begin to slow down in preparation to stop, and a target radius to 
            determine when we are within an acceptable range to stop. First, we find how far away we are from our desired orientation and in which direction we need to 
            move to reach it. If we are outside of the slow radius, we output maximum acceleration in the desired direction. If we are within the target radius, we 
            output an acceleration that will bring our rotation speed to 0. If we are within the slow radius, we set a desired speed that scales down based on how close we are 
            to the target orientation, and output an acceleration to target that speed. 
        </p>
        <img class="standalone-image" src="..\images\RotationAlgorithm.png" alt="Rotation algorithm in player controller">
        <p class="image-description">
            The output of this algorithm is used on event tick to always keep the ship's rotation in sync with the seesaw. The acceleration is converted to a speed based on 
            delta time and applied to a rotating movement component on the ship object. This allows us to smoothly accelerate and stop without stutters. 
            This algorithm does introduce a slight delay in the movement. Because it focuses on acceleration and smoothness, it will lag slightly behind the actual tilt of the 
            seesaw as it accelerates and decelerates. In testing we found it did not cause problems, and it looked significantly better than before.

        <h2>Other Systems</h2>
        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <div class="game-preview">
            <img class="game-image" src="..\images\MorningEnvironment.png" alt="Level 1 morning environment">
            <img class="game-image" src="..\images\DaytimeEnvironment.png" alt="Level 3 foggy environment">
        </div>
        <p class="image-description">
            Rather than having the player's ship move through the environment, we decided to have the environment move past the ship. This allowed us to not worry about how 
            long it would take players to complete any given level, and to allow us to change the length of the level based on the number of enemies we spawned in. 
            I made an environment manager to drive this. It spawns environment objects, moves them through the scene, and despawns them once they are no longer visible.
            When an object is spawned, it is given a random rotation and a random mesh from a list that is passed in. This allowed us to make fewer assets but have additional
            variety in the environment. The rotation can be constrained to the z-axis only for objects like islands. The speed of the object is also set so that 
            objects that are further away can move at different speeds to look more realistic. The spawning function runs in a loop that has a minimum delay between objects 
            and a maximum variance in that delay. Several of these loops can be run at the same time to allow for different types of objects to be spawned consistently at different 
            distances and speeds. In each level 1 or 2 of these loops spawn objects on each side of the ship. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p class="image-description">
            In addition to spawning objects, the environment manager changes other properties about the environment. The color of the water texture is adjusted along with the skybox 
            to give the illusion of changing weather and time of day. In the fog and boss levels the lighting is also changed to better match the desired effect. For the fog level,
            additional fog volumes are activated. In the boss level, there are rain and lightning effects that replace the wind effect present in the other levels. The lightning 
            effect picks a random location along a plane in which to play a lightning strike. The way I implemented the lightning seems somewhat inefficient, but I ran out of time to 
            investigate it further. Moving forward I'd like to learn how to better work with the VFX that my team creates.

        <h3>Level Flow</h3>
        <img class="standalone-image" src="..\images\BOMBMainMenu.png" alt="BOMB Main Menu">
        <p class="image-description">
            I created a level manager to handle the overall state of the game, transitions between levels, and communicate with other game managers.
            The level manager directs the environment, enemy, and boss managers. The boss and enemy managers were created by other engineers.
            When the game starts, the players are shown objects in the world in place of a traditional UI menu. To start the game, each player must shoot the object 
            that says "Start Game." This sends a message to the level manager to begin the first level. 
        </p>

        <div class="game-preview">
            <img class="game-image" src="..\images\Lvl1Screen.png" alt="Level 1 transition screen">
            <img class="game-image" src="..\images\LoseScreen.png" alt="Lose transition screen">
        </div>
        <p class="image-description">
            To start each level, the level manager shows a transition screen to both players and notifies the environment manager to update to the current level. 
            After the transition screen is complete, the level manager tells the enemy manager to begin spawning enemies according to the level. 
            It also sets the music based on the current level. After all enemies are defeated, the enemy manager sends a message back to the level manager and 
            the process is repeated. When the boss level is reached, the level manager instead sends a message to the boss manager to begin the boss fight. 
            After the player defeats the boss or their HP drops to 0, the level manager shows an appropriate transition, resets the game state, and returns to the main menu.
