        <h2>Controller Programming</h2>

        <p class="image-description">
            To use a seesaw as a controller we attached an Arduino Nano 33 IoT to the center of the seesaw along with a button on each side.
            I programmed the Arduino to read the angle of the seesaw along with the on/off state of the buttons. 
            That data is encoded into a 5-digit string and sent over the serial port 10 times per second. 
            This frequency was initially meant to be a placeholder value, but after testing there didn't seem to be 
            any issues with the frequency of the input, so I kept it at 10 Hz.
            We initially used an Arduino Mega 2560 with an attached module, but switched to the Nano.
            This was because the Mega 2560 was less consistent in giving the correct output. The Mega 2560 still works, but the Nano works better.
            We also considered using the Bluetooth functionality of the Nano, but it was cut to save time as well as reduce input latency.
